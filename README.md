# Online Laboratory for Data Compression in Climate Science and Meteorology

Welcome to the **Online Laboratory for Data Compression in Climate Science and Meteorology**!

This laboratory consists of several Jupyter notebooks that introduce lossy compression of weather and climate datasets, gives an overview of available compressors, and sets out several compression challenges.

You can read through the notebooks in [book form](https://climet-eu.github.io/compression-lab-notebooks/) or follow along in your own [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) environment.


## Getting Started

### (a) Local installation

First, clone the this repository using git:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/climet-eu/compression-lab-notebooks.git
cd compression-lab-notebooks
```

We use the `uv` Python package manager. If you have not yet installed `uv` on your system, you can find instructions here: <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>.
Afterwards, you can create a fresh virtual environment and install all dependencies using:

```shell
uv sync
```

Finally, you can run Jupyter Lab using:

```shell
uv run jupyter lab
```

### (b) Setup-free Online Laboratory

Alternatively, you can open the notebooks in the [Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology](https://docs.climet.eu/lab/) at <https://compression.lab.climet.eu/> and get started right away.

Please note that compression in the Online Laboratory currently only works in recent Firefox and Chrome browsers.

## Glossary

**Bit Pattern**
: The bits that make up a number, e.g. the 32 bits for a single-precision floating-point number.

**Codec**
: An algorithm that transforms the data from one representation to another (encoding) and back (decoding).

**Compression**
: Reducing the number of bits needed to store some data.

**Compressor**
: A codec that implements compression and decompression.

**Filter**
: A codec that transforms the data to make it more easily compressible without necessarily reducing its byte size directly itself.

**IEEE 754 Floating Point Number**
: A number with dynamic precision $(-1)^{s} \cdot 2^{e-b} \cdot 1.m\ldots$ that is represented by its sign $s$, its binary exponent $e$ with bias $b$, and a mantissa $m\ldots$ that encodes the binary fractional multiplier.

**Lossless Compression**
: Compression that reproduces the original bits exactly during decompression.

**Lossy Compression**
: Compression that may only produce an approximation of the original data during decompression.

**Meta-Compressor**
: A compressor that wraps one or more other compressors and transforms the data they work with. Meta-compressors can be used to combine multiple compressors or to provide extra functionality on top of existing compressors.
